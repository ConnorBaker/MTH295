% Problem 1
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that if the real-valued function $f$ is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on $\R$, then $f$ is one-to-one (Note:  You cannot assume $f$ is differentiable).
\end{enumerate}



% Proof 1
\begin{proof}
  Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing.

  If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $\forall\ x,a\in\dom(f),\ x\leq a,\ f(x) \geq f(a)$. If it is the case that $f(x)=f(a)$, then it must also be the case that $x=a$. Then, $f(x)=f(a)$ if and only if $x=a$, and $f(x) > f(a)\ \forall x,a\in\dom(f),\ x < a$, the function $f$ must be one-to-one.

  Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing.

  If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $\forall\ x,a\in\dom(f),\ x\leq a,\ f(x) \leq f(a)$. If it is the case that $f(x)=f(a)$, then it must also be the case that $x=a$. Then, $f(x)=f(a)$ if and only if $x=a$, and $f(x) < f(a)\ \forall x,a\in\dom(f),\ x < a$, the function $f$ must be one-to-one.
\end{proof}

% Problem 2
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[2.] Prove the following are metrics:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $X = \R, d(x,y) =  \begin{cases} 0 & \mbox{if } x = y \\ 1 & \mbox{if } x \neq y \end{cases} $
    \item $X = \R \times \R, d((x,y),(z,w)) = \sqrt{(x-z)^2 + (y-w)^2}$
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{definition}[Metric]
    A metric on a set $X$ is a function $d: X \times X \to \R$ such that for all $x,y,z \in X$,
  \end{definition}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $d(x,y) \geq 0$
    \item $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$
    \item $d(x,y) = d(y,x),$
    \item $d(x,y) + d(y,z) \geq d(x,z)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}



% Proof 2
\begin{proof}
  We begin by proving that the first function is a metric.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The $\rang(d)=\{0,1\}$ so the function is definitely greater than or equal to zero for any inputted pair of values.
    \item By the definition of $d$, $d(x,y)=0$ if and only if $x=y$.
    \item Since the equals relationship is symmetric, $x=y \implies y=x$. As such, $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$, since the order of the inputs does not generate a unique output.
    \item Not completed.
  \end{enumerate}
  Therefore the first function is a metric. \\

  We now prove that the second function is a metric.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The $\rang(d)=\{0,1\}$ so the function is definitely greater than zero.
    \item By the definition of $d$, if and only if $x=y$ does $d(x,y)=1$.
    \item Since the equals relationship is symmetric, $x=y \implies y=x$. As such, $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$.
    \item Not completed.
  \end{enumerate}
  Therefore the function is a metric.
\end{proof}

% Problem 3
\begin{enumerate}
\item[3.] Let $f: \N \times \N \to \N$ be given by $f(m,n) = 2^{m-1}(2n-1)$.  Prove that $f$ is one-to-one and onto.
\end{enumerate}



% Proof 3
\begin{proof}[Proof: f is one-to-one]
  Let $m,n,p,q\in\N$ and $f(m,n)=f(p,q)$. Then,
  $$2^{m-1}(2n-1)=2^{p-1}(2q-1).$$

  Each side has two distinct factors: one that is even (a power of two), and one that is odd (two times a number less one). For these two numbers to be even, they must have the same power factor of two, so it must be the case that:
  $$2^{m-1}=2^{p-1}.$$

  As such, by taking the $log_2$ of both sides and using cancellation on the negative one shared on both sides, we find $m=p$. Additionally, since they have the same power factor of two, it must be the case that:
  $$(2n-1)=(2q-1).$$

  Using cancellation on the one and then the two, we find that $n=q$. As such, when $f(m,n)=f(p,q),$ it must also be the case that $(m,n)=(p,q)$, and $f: \N \times \N \to \N$ is one-to-one.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof: f is onto]
  Let $m,n,p\in\N$. Then, for all values $m,n$ in the natural numbers, there is a natural number $p$ such that $f(m,n)=p$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof: f is bijective]
  By the above two proofs, since $f$ is both one-to-one and onto, $f$ is bijective.
\end{proof}

% Problem 4
\begin{enumerate}
\item[4.] Let $f:A \to B$ be a function from a nonempty set $A$.  Prove that the set $ \mathcal{C} = \{f^{-1}(b): b \in \rang(f)\}$ is a partition of $A$.  Note:  $\mathcal{C}$ is a subset of $\mathscr{P}(A)$.
\end{enumerate}



% Proof 4
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\begin{definition}[Partition]
  A set $B$ is said to be a partition of a set $A$ if:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\emptyset\not\in B$
    \item $\forall C,D \in B, C\cap D= \emptyset$ when $C\neq D$
    \item $\cap_{C\in B} C = A$
    \item $B\subseteq \mathcal{P}(A)$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proof}
  The set $C$ does not have $\emptyset$ as an element since that would mean that $A$ contains the empty set -- but it does not, since $A$ is a nonempty set. As such, the first condition is met.



  The fourth condition is met because it is given.
\end{proof}



\pagebreak



% Problem 5
\begin{enumerate}
\item[5.] Let $f:A \to B$ be a function from a nonempty set $A$ which is surjective.  Find a new function $g:C \to B$ which is one-to-one such that $C \subseteq A$, $\rang(g) = \rang(f)$, and for every $x \in C, f(x) = g(x)$.  Explain why $g$ has an inverse function, $g^{-1}$.  Then, compute $f(g^{-1}(x))$ for all $x \in B$.
\end{enumerate}



% Proof 5
\begin{proof}
  Since $\rang(g) = \rang(f)$, and $\rang(f) = B$ (because $f$ is surjective), $\rang(g) = B$, and $g$ is surjective. Additionally, since $g$ was given as injective, $g$ must be bijective. The function $g$ has an inverse because it is bijective, and that inverse is bijective. For all $x \in B$, the function $f(g^{-1}(x))$ is equivalent to $f(C)$ (since $\rang(g^{-1}) = C$). Furthermore, $f(C)=B$, since $C\subseteq A$ and $\forall c\in C, f(x)=g(x)$.
\end{proof}

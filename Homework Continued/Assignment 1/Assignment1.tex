\begin{enumerate}
\item[5.] Construct a bounded set of real numbers with exactly three limit points.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}[CHECK ME]
Let $E$ be the set of numbers such that:
$$E = \left\{\frac{1}{n} + a: n\in\N, a\in\{0,1,2\} \right\}.$$

Then the set of limit points of $E$, must contain at least 0, 1, and 2, since their neighborhoods all contain infinitely many points of $E$. As such, $\{0,1,2\}\subseteq E'$. \\

We now show that $E'$ contains only 0, 1, and 2. \\

Suppose that there is some limit point $x\not\in\{0,1,2\}$. Let $\epsilon = \min(d(x,0),\ d(x,1),\ d(x,2))$ (we want the smallest radius possible). Then the neighborhood $$N_\frac{\epsilon}{2} (x) = \left\{y: d(x,y) < \frac{\epsilon}{2}\right\}$$
does not contain the set $\{0, 0+\frac{\epsilon}{2}\}\cup\{1, 1+\frac{\epsilon}{2}\}\cup\{2, 2+\frac{\epsilon}{2}\}$ (known limit points of $E$, which by definition have neighborhoods which are not finite), so it contains at most finitely many points of $E$. \\

Since it is finite, we know that $E\cap N_\frac{\epsilon}{2} (x) = \{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_i\}$. Let $\delta = \min(\frac{\epsilon}{2},\ d(x,p_j))$ where $x\neq p_j$. Then, the set $A=\{y\in N_\frac{\epsilon}{2} (x): d(x,y) < \delta\}$ contains no points of $E$ -- except maybe $x$. As such, $x\not\in E'$, and $E' = \{0,1,2\}$.


%   The point $p$ is a limit point of $\{\frac{1}{n}:n\in\N\}$ if $\forall r>0, N_r(p)\cap E$ has infinitely many points. \\

%   Claim: Zero is a limit point of $\{\frac{1}{n}:n\in\N\}$. \\

%   For zero, $N_r(0) = \{x:d(x,0) < r\} = \{x: |x-0| < r\} = \{x: -r <x< r\} = (-r,r)$. Since $(r,r)\subseteq \R, \forall r>0,$ there are uncountably infinitely many points and $(r,r)\cap\{\frac{1}{n}:n\in\N\}$ has infinitely many points. \\

%   It is important to note that we can shift the location of this limit point. Consider the set $\{\frac{1}{n}+1:n\in\N\}$. For the same reasons above we can see that the limit point here is one. \\

%   In general, we can make a bounded set of real numbers with exactly $p, p\in\Z^+,$ limit points with the set
%   $$\bigcup_{k=0}^{p} \{\frac{1}{n}+k: n\in\N\}.$$

%   So, if we want three limit points, our set is as
%   $$\left\{\frac{1}{n}: n\in\N\right\}\bigcup\left\{\frac{1}{n}+1: n\in\N\right\}\bigcup\left\{\frac{1}{n}+2: n\in\N\right\}.$$
\end{proof}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[6.] Let $E'$ be the set of all limit points of a set $E$. Prove that $E'$ is closed. Prove that $E$ and $\bar{E}$ have the same limit points. (Recall that $\bar{E} = E \cup E'.$) Do $E$ and $E'$ always have the same limit points?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
Prove that $E'$ is closed. \\

The set $E'$ is closed if it contains its own limit points. \\

Let $x\in \bar{E}'$.

% Assume that $p$ is a limit point of $E'$. Then, $\exists x\neq p,$ (since if $x=p, d(x,p)=0$, and the neighborhood has a finite number of points, so there can not exist a limit point). We fix $r>0$, so $\exists x\in E'\cap N_{\frac{r}{2}}(p)$ and $\exists y\in E \cap N_{\frac{r}{2}}(x)$. \\

% Since $x\in E'$, $x$ is a limit point of $E$, by the definition of $E'$. As such, $\exists y\in E: d(x,y) < \frac{r}{2}$. By the triangle inequality:
% $$d(y,p) \leq d(y,x) + d(x,p).$$

% Substituting using the inequalities described above:
% $$d(y,p) < \frac{r}{2}+\frac{r}{2} =r,$$

% so $p$ is a limit point of $E$. Since $p$ is a limit point of $E$, it must be in $E'$. Therefore, since $E'$ contains its own limit points, it is closed.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
Proof that $E$ and $\bar{E}$ have the same limit points. \\

By the previous proof, $E'$ is closed and therefore contains its own limit points. \\

Let $\bar{E}'$ be the set of all limit points of $\bar{E}$. \\

We begin by showing that $E'\subseteq \bar{E}'$. \\

Let $x\in E'$. Then $x\in  $

\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[CHECK ME]
  Do $E$ and $E'$ always have the same limit points? \\

  Consider the set
  $$E = \left\{\frac{1}{n}: n\in\N\right\}.$$

  Then the limit point of that set is zero, so $E' = \{0\}$. However, the limit points of $E'$ are the empty set. We know this because to be a limit point, the intersection of the neighborhood and the set must have infinitely many points. This is not possible for our $E'$, since we have at most a single point in the intersection. \\
\end{proof}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[7.] Let $A_1,A_2,A_3,\dots$ be subsets of a metric space.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $B_n = \cup_{i=1}^{n} A_i,$ prove that $\bar{B}_n = \cup_{i=1}^{n} \bar{A}_i,$ for $n=1,2,3,\dots$.
  \item If $B = \cup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i,$ prove that $\bar{B} \supset \cup_{i=1}^{\infty} \bar{A}_i.$
\end{enumerate}
Show, by an example, that this inclusion can be proper.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[8.] Is every point of every open set $E \subset \R^2$ a limit point of $E$? Answer the same question for closed sets in $\R^2$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}[CHECK ME]
Since $E$ is open, all elements of $E$ are interior points. \\

Let $p\in E$. Choose $r>0$, and let $N_r(p)$ be a neighborhood of $p$. Since $p$ is an interior point, $\exists \delta > 0: N_\delta (p) \subseteq E$. \\

Choose $0<\epsilon \leq \min(r,\delta)$. Since $N_\epsilon (p)$ contains infinitely many points of $E$, $N_r(p)$ does as well. \\

As such, $N_\epsilon (p) \subseteq N_\delta (p) \subseteq E$ and $N_\epsilon (p) \subseteq N_r (p)$. \\

Closed sets, by definition contain all of their own limit points, so any closed subset of $\R^2$ will contain its own limit points. However, it is not the case that any finite set of $E$ will have limit points since the neighborhood intersect $E$ will be finite.
\end{proof}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[9.] Let $E^\circ$ denote the set of all interior points of a set $E$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prove that $E^\circ$ is always open.
  \item Prove that $E$ is open if and only if $E^\circ = E$.
  \item If $G \subset E$ and $G$ is open, prove that $G\subset E^\circ$.
  \item Prove that the complement of $E^\circ$ is the closure of the complement of $E$.
  \item Do $E$ and $\bar{E}$ always have the same interiors?
  \item Do $E$ and $E^\circ$ always have the same closures?
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
Proof that $E^\circ$ is always open. \\

$E^\circ = \{p: N_r(p) \subseteq E$ for some $r\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[CHECK ME]
Proof that $E$ is open if and only if $E^\circ = E$. \\

Assume that $E^\circ =E$. Then, $E$ is the set of all interior points of $E$. Since every point of $E$ is an interior point, $E$ is open.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[CHECK ME]
If $G \subset E$ and $G$ is open, prove that $G\subset E^\circ$. \\

Since $G$ is open, every point of $G$ is an interior point of $G$. Since $G\subseteq E$, $G$ is a set of some number of interior points of $E$, so $G\subseteq E^\circ$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
Prove that the complement of $E^\circ$ is the closure of the complement of $E$. \\

$(E^\circ)^c = \bar{E^c} = (E^c \cup E'^c)$?
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
Do $E$ and $\bar{E}$ always have the same interiors?
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
Do $E$ and $E^\circ$ always have the same closures? \\

Since $\bar{E} = E\cup E'$, and $\bar{E}^\circ = E^\circ \cup E'^\circ$, we must show that $\bar{E} \subset \bar{E}^\circ$ and $\bar{E}^\circ \subset \bar{E}$. \\

$\bar{E} \subset \bar{E}^\circ$: \\

$\bar{E}^\circ \subset \bar{E}$:
